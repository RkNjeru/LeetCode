Familiarize with and solve well-know problems

1. write a method that prints the contents of a tree using depth-first search

2. Find the balancing point of an array. 
    At which element does the sum of left elements
    equals sum of right elements

3. Refresher on recursion

1) Coding. The candidate has to write some simple code, with correct syntax, in C, C++, or Java.

2) OO design. The candidate has to define basic OO concepts, and come up with classes to model a simple problem.

3) Scripting and regexes. The candidate has to describe how to find the phone numbers in 50,000 HTML pages.

4) Data structures. The candidate has to demonstrate basic knowledge of the most common data structures.

5) Bits and bytes. The candidate has to answer simple questions about bits, bytes, and binary numbers.

Binary Tree
    manipulation
    trees are not linear like array or linked lists
    traversal
        traversal means read/processing the data of a node exactly one in some order in a tree
        time complexity of all traversal is O(n) since all nodes are visisted once

        breadths first
            also known as level order
            level by level    
        depth first
              Preorder: 
                   <root><left><right>
                                 Inorder
                  <left><root><right>
              Postorder
                  <left><right><root>
